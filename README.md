# Airline-Satisfaction
# Problem Statement
Passengers who are dissatisfied with a particular airline have a higher likelihood of not using that airline’s services again. Bad reviews also deter new customers. This leads to decreased profit. Our main aim is to explore the factors influencing satisfaction and build a model that can predict whether a passenger is generally satisfied or dissatisfied with an airline.
# General Objective
Build a model that can predict a passenger’s satisfaction with an airline.
# Specific Objectives
- Determine the relationships between overall level of satisfaction and various predictor variables (such as gender, travel class, inflight wifi service, etc).
- Determine the correlation between overall level of satisfaction and the predictor variables.
- Determine the top factors affecting satisfaction with an airline.
- Build a model that can predict a passenger’s overall satisfaction with an airline.
